My dad and my mom is really caring to me and I love them very much. My brother is the one who is really irritating to me and naughty one,but I love him very much. 
In my school ,I had two best friends. I miss them very much. I hope that I will be a really good friend to everybody here at fwsa.

    <p>I am very good at studies throughout my school days.I got passed my 12 th with decent marks. But then comes a question , what should I do next? I want to be software engineer. 
But my family is in a financial constraint. I dont want my parents to suffer for the money issues.I want to be financially independent while studying. 
And I always looking for a better<i> alternative for conventional education</i>. Because finally FSSA is the right place where I have to be .And I am here.
