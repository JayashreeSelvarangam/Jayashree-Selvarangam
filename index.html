	<p>I am very good at studies throughout my school days. After completing 12th ,then comes a question to me that what should I do next? I wanted to be a software engineer. 
But my family is in a financial constraint. I dont want my parents to suffer for money issues.So I wanted to be financially independent while studying. 
And I was always looking for a better<i> alternative for conventional education</i>. Finally FSSA is the right place where I have to be.I am greatful to be here.
